Raw and parsed blastx output files are provided.
File "match_report" describes the top ranked hit alignment for each 
contig that satisfied the E-value threshold.  If blastx 
was performed in "all" hit mode then values for hit_cnt and species_cnt 
are relevant and refer to the number of unique RefSeq sequences and 
species detected by a given contig, thereby giving indication of the 
size and prevalence of the gene family. Remaining columns describe characteristics of the 
top ranked hit and alignment. The value of hit_freq refers to how often the 
RefSeq sequence was detected as the top ranked hit among the different 
contigs (i.e. how many contigs detected the sequence as top hit).  This 
can provide some indication of repetitiveness of the gene.  The 
pct_id is the percent of amino acids matched in the hit. 
The contig_cov and top_hit_cov are the fraction of length contained 
in high scoring pairs for the contig and RefSeq hit respectively. 
The qhlr is the ratio of the contig translation length (estimated by 
dividing the contig nucleotide length by 3) to the length of the 
aligned RefSeq protein. Note that the estimated length can be an 
over-estimate as it does not account for 5- or 3-UTR. A qhlr < 1 means 
the RefSeq protein is longer than the estimated translation length of 
the contig. A qhlr > 1 means the estimated translation length of the contig 
is greater than the length of the hit. 
File "no_hit_contigs" lists the contigs that did not align at 
threshold.
File "quality_stats" gives distribution statistics on qhlr, hit coverage, 
E-value and other metrics to gauge quality of the assembly and enable 
comparison among different assemblies.
File "diversity_report" gives counts for the number of unique RefSeq 
sequences that were aligned broken down by species at the level of top 
hits and considering all hits if run in "all" hits mode.
